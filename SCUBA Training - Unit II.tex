	% 2.
	\begin{qanda}
		\begin{question}
How does water affect light intensity and color?
		\end{question}

		\begin{answer}
Water absorbs and reflects light, so in deeper water it is darker and less colorful.
		\end{answer}
	\end{qanda}

	% 3.
	\begin{qanda}
		\begin{question}
How does being underwater affect hearing?
		\end{question}

		\begin{answer}
Sound travels farther in water than in air, so you'll be able to hear things at distances that you can't in air.  Sound also travels about four times faster in water than in air, this makes it difficult to tell where a sound comes from.
		\end{answer}

	\begin{qanda}
		\begin{question}
How should you move underwater to compensate for the increased resistance of water?
		\end{question}

		\begin{answer}
Conserve energy by moving slowly and steadily.  Swim level to reduce drag.  More weight means you have to use more air in your BCD, which prevents you from swimming horizontally.

Proper airway control means to:
			\begin{nospacenumberedlist}

				\item Looking downward slightly helps keep the water in the second stage and out of your mouth
			\end{nospacenumberedlist}
		\end{answer}
