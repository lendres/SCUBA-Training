    \begin{qanda}
\question{How does looking at something underwater affect its apparent size?}

\answer{Things look larger and/or closer.}
    \end{qanda}

    % 2.
    \begin{qanda}
\question{How does water affect light intensity and color?}

\answer{Water absorbs and reflects light, so in deeper water it is darker and less colorful.}
    \end{qanda}

    % 3.
    \begin{qanda}
\question{How does being underwater affect hearing?}

\answer{Sound travels farther in water than in air, so you'll be able to hear things at distances that you can't in air.  Sound also travels about four times faster in water than in air, this makes it difficult to tell where a sound comes from.}
    \end{qanda}

    % 4.
    \begin{qanda}
\question{How does the rate of body heat loss in water compare to the rate of body heat loss in air?}

\answer{Water conducts heat 20 times faster than air.}
    \end{qanda}

    % 5.
    \begin{qanda}
\question{What should you do if you begin to shiver continuously underwater?}

\answer{Get out of the water immediately, dry off, and seek warmth.}
    \end{qanda}

    % 6.
    \begin{qanda}
\question{How should you move underwater to compensate for the increased resistance of water?}

\answer{Conserve energy by moving slowly and steadily.  Swim level to reduce drag.  More weight means you have to use more air in your BCD, which prevents you from swimming horizontally.}
    \end{qanda}

    % 7.
    \begin{qanda}
\question{How do you breathe underwater for maximum efficiency?}

\answer{Slowly and deeply.}
    \end{qanda}

    % 8.
    \begin{qanda}
\question{What are eight symptoms of diving overexertion?}

\answer{Overexertion symptoms include fatigue, labored breathing, a feeling of suffocation, weakness, anxiety, headache, muscle cramping and a tendency to panic.}
    \end{qanda}

    % 9.
    \begin{qanda}
\question{How do you prevent diving overexertion?}

\answer{You prevent overexertion by staying relaxed and knowing your limits.}
    \end{qanda}

    % 10.
    \begin{qanda}
\question{What should you do if you become overexerted while diving -- either at the surface or underwater?}

\answer{Stop all activity and rest underwater.  At surface, establish buoyancy and stop moving.  One you recover, continue at a slower pace.}
    \end{qanda}

    % 11.
    \begin{qanda}
\question{What are four techniques used for airway control?}

\answer{Proper airway control means to:
    \begin{numberedlist}
        \item Always inhale slowly if water enters your regulator, snorkel or mouth, so you don't pull it into your throat
        \item Always inhale cautiously and slowly after clearing your snorkel or regulator
        \item Use your tongue as a splash guard by putting the tip on the roof of your mouth when you breath past small amounts of water
        \item Looking downward slightly helps keep the water in the second stage and out of your mouth
    \end{numberedlist}}
    \end{qanda}

    % 12.
    \begin{qanda}
\question{What are the two reasons for wearing an exposure suit while diving?}

\answer{To reduce heat loss and to protect you from minor scrapes, stings and abrasions.}
    \end{qanda}

    % 13.
    \begin{qanda}
\question{How do dry suits and wet suits insulate divers?}

\answer{By putting a layer of insulation over your skin.}
    \end{qanda}

    % 14.
    \begin{qanda}
\question{Why must a wet suit fit snugly?}

\answer{To prevent water from circulating through it.  If water circulates you lose heat to incoming cold water.}
    \end{qanda}

    % 15.
    \begin{qanda}
\question{What two properties may an exposure suit lose due to increased water pressure at depth?}

\answer{Buoyancy and insulation.}
    \end{qanda}

    % 16.
    \begin{qanda}
\question{What three factors should you consider when selecting an exposure suit?}

\answer{Insulating ability, fit, and comfort.}
    \end{qanda}

    % 17.
    \begin{qanda}
\question{What four procedures apply to caring for an exposure suit?}

\answer{Exposure suits have four basic maintenance steps:
    \begin{numberedlist}
        \item Rinse
        \item Dry inside out
        \item Store
        \item Lubricate dry suit zippers periodically
    \end{numberedlist}}
    \end{qanda}

    % 18.
    \begin{qanda}
\question{Why do you need a hood and what are the three basic types of hoods?}

\answer{You loose body heat through your head.  75 percent if wearing a full body exposure suit, but leave your head uncovered.  The three basic types are bibbed hoods, non-bibbed hoods, and hooded vests.}
    \end{qanda}

    % 19.
    \begin{qanda}
\question{Why should you avoid an excessively tight-fitting hood?}

\answer{A hood that is too tight can compress arteries in your neck, which the brain perceives as high blood pressure and then lowers your heart rate.}
    \end{qanda}

    % 20.
    \begin{qanda}
\question{What are two reasons for wearing dive gloves?}

\answer{To protect against heat loss and injuries.}
    \end{qanda}

    % 21.
    \begin{qanda}
\question{What are three reasons for wearing wet suit boots while diving?}

\answer{Warmth, protection against injuries while walking to and from the water, and for comfort when wearing adjustable-strap fins.}
    \end{qanda}

    % 22.
    \begin{qanda}
\question{In what six ways can you prevent overheating before a dive when wearing an exposure suit?}

\answer{The six ways to prevent overheating are:
    \begin{numberedlist}
        \item Set up all your equipment before putting on the exposure suit and then put the suit on at the last possible moment
        \item Once you have the suit on, limit your activity as much as possible
        \item Stay out of the sun as much as possible
        \item keep your hood off, of at least pulled back off your head as long as possible
        \item Leave your jacket unzipped as long as possible
        \item Cool off by entering the water, or spraying down with a hose
    \end{numberedlist}}

    \end{qanda}

    % 24.
    \begin{qanda}
\question{What's the most important feature of any weight system?}

\answer{The quick release feature.}
    \end{qanda}

    % 25.
    \begin{qanda}
\question{How do you determine how much weight you need for a dive?}

\answer{With your regulator in, your BCD deflated, and holding a normal breath you should have enough weight to float at eye level.  When you exhale you should slowly descend.  Then add 5 pounds to offset the air you will loose from your cylinder.}
    \end{qanda}

    % 26.
    \begin{qanda}
\question{What's an alternate air source?}

\answer{Any second stage you may use, other than your own primary second stage, to ascend while breathing normally.}
    \end{qanda}

    % 27.
    \begin{qanda}
\question{What two types of alternate air source require the help and cooperation of another diver?}

\answer{Alternate air second stage and the alternate inflator regulator.}
    \end{qanda}

    % 28.
    \begin{qanda}
\question{What type of alternate air source does not require the help and cooperation of another diver?}

\answer{The pony bottle or ascent bottle.}
    \end{qanda}

    % 29.
    \begin{qanda}
\question{Why it is important to specially mark an extra second stage used as an alternate air source?}

\answer{Marking it clearly makes it easy to identify quickly and without confusion in an emergency.}
    \end{qanda}

    % 30.
    \begin{qanda}
\question{How and where should you attach your alternate air source?}

\answer{Secure the alternate to your chest in the triangle formed by your chin and the lower corners of your rib cage.}
    \end{qanda}

    % 31.
    \begin{qanda}
\question{Why do you need a low pressure inflator?}

\answer{To quickly and easily inflate your BCD.}
    \end{qanda}

    % 32.
    \begin{qanda}
\question{Why do you need a dive knife or dive tool?}

\answer{For safety and convenience.  You can use it to cut, pry, saw, and pound.}
    \end{qanda}

    % 33.
    \begin{qanda}
